## Tasks for Operating System 

- [ ] Process Scheduling: The operating system determines the order and priority in which processes are executed on the CPU.

- [ ]Interprocess Communication: The operating system facilitates communication and data sharing between different processes running on the system.

- [ ] Memory Paging: The operating system manages the division of physical memory into fixed-sized blocks called pages and maps them to virtual memory addresses.

- [ ] Input/Output (I/O) Handling: The operating system manages input and output operations, including handling device drivers, interrupt handling, and buffering.

- [ ] File and Directory Management: The operating system provides operations for creating, deleting, and manipulating files and directories.

- [ ] Create one docker image for a web server and another for a database server. Connect them using docker networking.

- [ ] Create a docker-compose file to run both the containers together.

- [ ] Create a docker container inside a docker container.
